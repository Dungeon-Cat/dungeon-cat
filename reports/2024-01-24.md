## Team Report

### Previous Goals

- n/a for First Week

#### Progress and Issues

This week we set up the git repository, connected it to Unity, and made sure team members had their local development environment configured. 
We found that meeting up in class sections and over discord voice calls worked well to coordinate activities and complete assignments. 
We learned more about C# and game development as we planned out our roles and the overarching structure of the project.
We have been having trouble getting started on the actual game development process collaboratively. Often our meetings are dedicated to planning, designing, and finishing assignments more so than coding. 
This isn’t bad for this stage of course, but it leaves us worried about our ability to have a beta version of the project in two weeks. 
Our script engineers are stuck until the scene masters create the scenes and we have a better understanding of our plan.

#### Plans and Goals

- Complete the Architecture and Design assignment
  - James will make a first outline for a possible Architecture and Design including Unity (1 day)
  - Mark will properly update the living document in response to TA feedback (1 day)
  - Milo will revise the quarter schedule formatting (1 day)
  - The group will discuss and finalize the Software Architecture and Design (1 day)
- Start the Testing and Continuous Integration assignment
  - James will investigate a setup involving GitHub actions and GameCI (2 days)
  - If issues with that arise, the team will regroup next week and adapt
- Begin real development of Dungeon Cat
  - Taryn and Brandon will start on the level design and scene objects (3 days)
  - Milo and Mark will start working on basic scripts of the game (3 days)
  - James will provide help with using Unity to either group as necessary (3 days)
