#### Progress and Issues

- Integrated the above into Milo’s Inventory UI
- Hooked up Mark’s dialogue UI to the tutorial level
- Added a simple chest opening feature for the tutorial
- Didn’t making living document updates yet due to time constraints, will do this week

#### Plans and Goals

- Try implementing some point and click movement for better potential playability on mobile devices (2 days)
- Allow the camera to move in certain ways so that we can make larger dungeon levels (2)
- Update the living document to reflection architecture changes/expansions, and add further info about adding new tests (1 day)

### Milo

#### Previous Goals

- Write script for cat (2 days)
- Write tests for cat scripts(1 day)
- Discuss with team to figure out the scripts to do before beta release(1 day)
- Work on the other scripting jobs for beta release(2 days)

#### Progress and Issues

- Instead of working on cat script, I switched my focus to implementing inventory UI
- Discussed with the team and figured out the design and challenges I encountered while working on inventory UI
- Implemented inventory manager script
- Worked on beta release presentation


#### Plans and Goals

- Work on optimizing of inventory UI(e.g. background image, scales) (1day)
- Implement and optimize other features that could be done through interaction with inventory UI (2 days)
- Discuss with teammates about features needed for final release(1 day)

### Brandon

#### Previous Goals

- Continue work on the conditions, expecting them to be relevant for certain items (2 days)
- Follow up on previous ideas to see if they are still part of the beta release (2 days)
- Continue working between some of the team, specifically in the item-to-level domain (3 days)


#### Progress and Issues

- The conditions system is in a good enough state to use it for most known cases.
- The beta release has almost all planned systems but isn’t quite showing their functionality; this is fine.
- The items have yet to be revisited by me specifically

#### Plans and Goals

- Touch up on the beta release presentation so I am prepared for it (<1 day)
- Pivot to starting another stage, using the systems in place that exist for the beta (3 days)
- Review system for “entity” updates to see if it is flexible enough (1 day)

### Mark

#### Previous Goals

- Implement event recognition functionality for dialogue to progress to next state; other general properties of dialogue (3 days)
- Make dialogue UI look reasonably nice (3 days)
- Implement tutorial popups (both scripting and UI) (3 days)

#### Progress and Issues

- Completed dialogue manager with reasonable UI
  - Event recognition is not as complete, though – right now, general dialogue progression command; need to extend dialogue progression to include dialogue options
- No progress on tutorial popups
- Drafted a script for beta release presentation

#### Plans and Goals

- Return to tutorial popups if deemed necessary (3 days)
- Discuss with teammates for next steps after beta release – likely hard pivot to level design and building content (2 days)
